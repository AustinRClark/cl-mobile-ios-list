iOS Grocery List

Have you ever finished grocery shopping only to realize that you inadvertently spent twice as much as you meant to? It's hard to keep track of how much everything in your cart costs! So let's make an app for that.

In this app, we're enabling our users to record each item as it goes in to their carts and displaying a running total.

This project is divided up in to model, view and controller sections (MVC). The only model we are using is the `Item` class which has been implemented for you. The view, located in `Main.storyboard`, has also been implemented for you. Your job is to finish implementing the controller code in the `ViewController` file. Note that it already has the necessary IBOutlet and IBAction connections to the view.

Submit the assignment by submitting a pull request. The steps to do that are as follows:

4. Push/sync the changes up to GitHub.
5. Create a pull request on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
